# Welcome to Palindrome Checker

first you need to choose an option, for now you only have 2 options :
1) Write a word to check if it is palindrome or not
2) Exit the program

if you choose option nÂ° 1, you write your word and press ENTER on your keyboard
and let the program does its job, then it will tell you if it is PALINDROME or NOT PALINDROME

Enjoy :)
